# Discrete and Continuous Difference of Submodular Minimization

Code to reproduce results of the paper [Discrete and Continuous Difference of Submodular Minimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07952)

## To reproduce results in the paper

### Integer least squares 
- run  script Least-Squares/ilsq.sh for exmperiments with varying measurements, or Least-Squares/noisy_ilsq.sh for exmperiments with varying noise.
- plot results using Least-Squares/plot_measurements.m for exmperiments with varying measurements, or Least-Squares/plot_noisy.m for exmperiments with varying noise.

### Integer compressed sensing 
- run  script CS/integer_cs.sh for exmperiments with varying measurements, or CS/noisy_integer_cs.sh for exmperiments with varying noise.
- plot results using CS/plot_measurements.m for exmperiments with varying measurements, or CS/plot_noisy.m for exmperiments with varying noise.

# Acknowledgements
- We use a number of functions implemented in [1] (such as the pairwise FW algorithm for submodular minimization). The code is available at http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/submodular_multi_online.zip.  
- We use the FISTA implementation from [2].
- We use for plotting the distinguishable_colors function from [3].
