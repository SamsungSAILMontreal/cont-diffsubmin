# Discrete and Continuous Difference of Submodular Minimization

Code to reproduce results of the paper [Discrete and Continuous Difference of Submodular Minimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07952).

## To reproduce results in the paper

### Integer least squares 
- run script Least-Squares/ilsq.sh for experiments with varying measurements, or Least-Squares/noisy_ilsq.sh for experiments with varying noise.
- plot results using Least-Squares/plot_measurements.m for experiments with varying measurements, or Least-Squares/plot_noisy.m for experiments with varying noise.

### Integer compressed sensing 
- run  script CS/integer_cs.sh for experiments with varying measurements, or CS/noisy_integer_cs.sh for experiments with varying noise.
- plot results using CS/plot_measurements.m for experiments with varying measurements, or CS/plot_noisy.m for experiments with varying noise.

- We use a number of functions implemented from [1] (such as the pairwise FW algorithm for submodular minimization).  
- We use the FISTA implementation from [2].
- We use the ADMM heuristic for mixed-integer quadratic programming from [3].
- Our implementation of OMP is based on the implementation in [4].
- We use for plotting the distinguishable_colors function from [5].
