# Acknowledgements
- We use a number of functions implemented in [1] (such as the pairwise FW algorithm for submodular minimization). The code is available at http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/submodular_multi_online.zip.  
- We use the FISTA implementation from [2].
- We use for plotting the distinguishable_colors function from [3].
